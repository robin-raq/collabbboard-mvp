# CollabBoard MVP — Code Conventions

## Stack
- Frontend: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Konva.js, react-konva, Yjs
- Backend: Node.js 20, ws, Yjs (WebSocket relay only)
- Auth: Clerk (@clerk/clerk-react)
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (WebSocket server)

## Architecture
- All board state lives in a Yjs Y.Map — never in React state directly
- useYjs.ts is the single source of truth for sync logic
- Server is a stateless relay (no Express, no REST API, no database)
- Console logging on every mutation for debugging ([YJS CREATE], [YJS UPDATE], etc.)

## Conventions
- Components: PascalCase.tsx
- Hooks: useCamelCase.ts
- No class components
- No `any` types — define proper interfaces
- Keep files small and focused (one component per file)

## Do NOT
- Add a database (Yjs in-memory is intentional for MVP)
- Add Express or REST routes (WebSocket only)
- Add a test framework (console-driven TDD only)
- Commit .env.local or API keys
